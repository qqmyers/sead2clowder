Interface
============

Once you have successfully installed Clowder, you can browse and create collections and datasets.

Publishing Data
---------------------------

Clowder directly supports submission of datasets to known repositories for publication.

If you would like to publish a dataset to a known repository, you can launch the Staging Area by navigating to the
dataset and clicking the Publish button.

**Create New Publication Request**

On the first page you can provide a name, description and one or more creators for your publication request. Click
Create once the required fields are populated.

**Edit Metadata**

Any existing metadata for the dataset will be shown on this page, but you have the opportunity to add additional metadata
if desired. Click Select Repository once all metadata is entered.

**Select Repository**

Depending on the dataset contents and metadata, a list of candidate repositories will be displayed that you can choose
from. Expand "Matchmaker Details" to see an itemized list of requirements for the repository and indicators whether
your dataset meets those requirements.

Once you select **Submit to Repository** will have one last chance to review your information before submitting.

You can use the **Explore > Published Data** link in the header menu to see a list of published datasets.
