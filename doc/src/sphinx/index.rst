   :width: 750px

Welcome to Clowder's documentation. Clowder is a web-based data management system that allows users to share, annotate,
organize and analyze large collections of datasets.
Clowder is open source software that can be customized and deployed on your own cloud.

The following pages give an overview of the project, how to get an instance up, and how to interact with existing
instances through the API.

The guide is still work in progress. If interested, please check often for updates.
