Creating Child Collections 
--------------------------

Child collections are a way to organize collections in a hierarchical way. You can create new child collections within a collections page. Collections created this way inherit the spaces that the parent collection is currently on. Child collections do not show up on the listing of collections to avoid cluttering, but they do show up as collections that you created in the home page. You can not remove child collections from a space that has been inherited from a parent collection.  You can also add existing collections to a parent collection. If the child collection was on a space that the parent collection was not in, you will be able to remove the child collection from that space. 

To create a child collection within a collection page. Click on the 'Create Child Collection' button in the Child Collections in the Collection section. The button is highlighted in a blue box in the next image.
